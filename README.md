A classic Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock player from The Big Bang Theory. Might add a computer-player version of the same in the future.

(The Rules: "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.")
